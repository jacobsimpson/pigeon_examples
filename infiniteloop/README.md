# infiniteloop

Don't copy this one. It's an example of a grammar that won't parse anything.

Sometimes I accidentally make a grammar that ends up in some kind of an
infinite loop while trying to parse input.

## Testing

This will never end.

```
./infiniteloop data/data1.txt
```

## Development

```
make
```
