# Pigeon Examples

Small project explorations of the Pigeon PEG parser generator.

### Setup

[Pigeon](https://github.com/mna/pigeon) is a parser generator. It is used as a
commandline tool that takes a `.peg` file and generates a `.go` file. Calling
the generated code will return the output of the parser.

```
go get -u github.com/mna/pigeon
```

The code generated by pigeon doesn't have all the necessary imports, so it is
useful to run the
[goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports) tool to
remediate the generated `.go` file.

```
go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
```
